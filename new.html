                We have mainly two functionalities of our website. This can be operated either by a citizen or by adoption centers.

                <span class="text-danger" style="font-size: 18px;">IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN</span> you will be having the provision to report their issue which is related to violation of child rights or child abuse in any way. Now, who are the people who come under term “citizens”? All responsible people in the country come under the term citizen. If anyone saw any kind of violation of child rights they can just enter their contact details and the issue which has occurred and can report it. Every entry is read and necessary action is taken in a short time. There is no gender or age discrimination anyone can report the issue, even the children who are facing any kind of problem such as if they are targeted to any abuse or feeling depressed they can just write their issue and send it. This would allow us to make a safer place for every child.

                <span class="text-danger" style="font-size: 18px;">IF YOU ARE AN ADOPTION CENTER OR AN OPRPHANAGE</span> you will have the provision of creating a database for the children present in their foundation or center. Generally, whenever the child is being transferred to some other adoption center or when the child’s responsibility is given to adoptive parents due to some factors there is a loss of data. Now, data always plays a very important role. Data helps to track the child and his/her well being and when were the data is lost it is difficult for the foundation to given the responsibility of a child to adoptive parents, which in turn steals the happiness and a chance of having a normal life as every other child does. Any adoption center or foundation can register in our web site after registration they would be getting their logins by which they can log in into the web site and enter the details of the children present in their foundation and whenever they are transferred to some other adoption center or if the responsibility of the child is given to adoptive parents the details of the child can be updated. By this, we can track the child and ensure his/her well being.
