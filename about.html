            <p class="text-info" style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; font-size: 19px;">
                Good cause,we have two main motives. Mainly it is to ensure the safety of the children, to make a better place for living and to save lives.
            </p>
            <div class="col-sm-12 text-info" >
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                One of which is to ensure safety to the children of the country. Many times people just don't understand what others are trying to say or people don't pay attention to it and in a matter of time, lives are lost. Every life is important, every soul is important. We believe that no one should remain unheard of the problems they are facing it might be some abuse at home or at their workplace or even if they see something wrong happening around them or it might also be the feeling of loneliness if their willing to share what's running in their brain and heart, they can just give their contact details and write about their issue. Every Issue would be read and required action would be taken. There is no age or gender restrictions for reporting their problem. This is mainly to ensure child's safety any one can fill in the issue that they think is inappropriate to a child or the child themself can file in the issue and every entry is read and action would be taken accordingly

            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                the second motive is regarding the adoption. Firstly, What is adoption? Adoption is where a child's responsibility is transferred to adoptive parents. This generally happens when any child has left alone by their biological parents or when the biological parents are no more. What generally happens is when some child is transferred to some other adoption center or due to some other factors the data of a child is lost. The data plays an important role in tracking the children their medicinal issues and also when they have to be given to the adoptive parents this data comes into the hand, if such data is lost then the child may lose the happiness which he deserves and the life he deserves and if the data is lost after adoption we wouldn't be having the track of the child and about the wellness of the child. In order to prevent such kind of events, we give login credentials to adoptive centers wherein they can upload the data of every child in their adoption center and when the child is transferred they can update the information. This would ensure that every child's safety and it would also make things a lot easier during adoption.
